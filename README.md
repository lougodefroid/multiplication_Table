# multiplication_Table
## This first project on Scratch was to create a multiplication table, so you can digit any number and Devin will tell you the multiplication from 1 to 10 * 

The project was created during class to undestand the programming logic, in general I'm very happy with the result and looking foward learn more and improve my coding.
